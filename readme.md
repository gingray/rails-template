### How to use
run ```rails new [NAME_OF_APP] -m /Users/gingray/github/rails-template/template.rb```
run ```rails generate devise:install```
run ```rails generate devise User```
run ```rails g rolify Role User```

it works good for classic rails app for API mode I've got errors when install RSpec  
I think here is boilerplate that using in most rails apps  
Have fun
